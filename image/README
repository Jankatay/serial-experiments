## What does this do?
When assembled in debian, and not void-linux for an unkown reason; produces a png file. 

## Why did you do this?
I wanted to see if I can learn about formats by just reading the official, legal specification.  

It went surprisingly well. Even the CRC was obtainable thanks to crc32 command. The actual IDAT_DATA has to be filtered and compressed tho.

So I relied on gimp and wikipedia to find out what one single pixel compressed looks like in the end and that was the entire outside help needed.
